# **RHETIC**
## RHETI (_Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator_) TUI in C

This is a relatively simple program in C to serve as an implementation of the **RHETI**, originally made by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson, for the Enneagram theory of personality. RHETI is taken from the book [_Discovering Your Personality Type_](https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Your-Personality-Type-Introduction/dp/061821903X). Support the authors by buying the book, if you like the test.
